​ What is Shell ?
  A shell is a computer program that exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other programs.
  
  
  A Shell provides you with an interface to the Unix system. It gathers input from you and executes programs based on that input. 
  When a program finishes executing, it displays that program's output. Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, 
  programs, and shell scripts. There are different flavors of a shell, just as there are different flavors of operating systems. 
  Each flavor of shell has its own set of recognized commands and functions.
  
  
​ Shell Prompt
  The prompt, $, which is called the command prompt, is issued by the shell. While the prompt is displayed, you can type a command.
  Shell reads your input after you press Enter.



​ Shell Types
  an Unix, there are two major types of shells −
      • Bourne shell − If you are using a Bourne-type shell, the $ character is the default prompt.
      • C shell − If you are using a C-type shell, the % character is the default prompt.
  The Bourne Shell has the following subcategories −
      • Bourne shell (sh)
      • Korn shell (ksh)
      • Bourne Again shell (bash)
      • POSIX shell (sh)
  The different C-type shells follow −
      • C shell (csh)
      • TENEX/TOPS C shell (tcsh)
  The original Unix shell was written in the mid-1970s by Stephen R. Bourne while he was at the AT&T Bell Labs in New Jersey.
  
  
  
​ Shell Scripts
  The basic concept of a shell script is a list of commands, which are listed in the order of execution. A good shell script will have comments,

  Shell scripts have 
   # variable
   # conditional 
   # read and write file
   # and several operations	
   
  
​ How to run Shell Scripts 
   # put commands in your script file (text.sh)
      echo "Hello script"
   # Save the file with .sh extension (text.sh)
   # Allow permission to executable mode 
      $chmod +x test.sh
   # run the script
      $./test.sh
