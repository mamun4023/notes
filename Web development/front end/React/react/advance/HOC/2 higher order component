Higher-Order Components (HOC) is a pattern in React that enables the creation of reusable logic for components. 
HOC is a function that takes a component as an input and returns a new component with some additional features. 
In this way, HOC enables you to abstract away common functionality from components and reuse it across different components.




import React from "react";

//  WithTitle component is a HOC 
const WithTitle = (WrapComponent, title) => {
  return (props) => {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1> {title} </h1>
        <WrapComponent {...props} />
      </div>
    );
  };
};

export default WithTitle;



import HOC from "./HOC";

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>This is my COmponent</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default HOC(MyComponent, "my Title");
