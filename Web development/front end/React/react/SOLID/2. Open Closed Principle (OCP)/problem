========== Problem statement =============

Problem 1: A Notification Component
Youâ€™re tasked with building a notification system that shows success, error, and info messages.

Initially, you create this component:

const Notification = ({ type, message }) => {
  let style = {};
  if (type === "success") style = { color: "green" };
  else if (type === "error") style = { color: "red" };
  else if (type === "info") style = { color: "blue" };

  return <div style={style}>{message}</div>;
};

Issues
- Closed to Extension: If new notification types (e.g., "warning") are required, you have to modify the component, which violates the closed for modification part of OCP.
- Hard to Maintain: As more types are added, the component becomes more complex, leading to spaghetti code.
