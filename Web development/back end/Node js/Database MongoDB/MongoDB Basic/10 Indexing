Create a "temp" database  and insert million of documents in collections in mongo shell

1. create temp database
    use temp

2. insert million of document into collections
    for(i = 0; i<1000000; i++){
      db.posts.insert({id : i, name : "tohid"})
    }
    
3. search the data with id = 1000000 (it will take longer time to read data)
    db.posts.find({id : 1000000})
    

Note : This query take longer time to read data. To solve this problem indexing come in the picture of developer. To do indexing be more careful 
about that you have to indexing only unique value of documents.


4. Indexing the collections (indexing with id)
    db.posts.ensureindex({id : 1})
    

5. Remove index
    db.posts.dropIndex({id : 1})

An index is a schema object that contains keys from various columns of our data table. B-Trees are used to store the index keys. 
It helps us find the rows or the values to be searched faster. They have various advantages like increased performance in searching 
for records, sorting records, grouping records, or maintaining a unique column. Some of the disadvantages include increased disk space, 
slower data modification, and updating records in the clustered index.
