What is Event loop?

The event loop is a programming design pattern that waits for and dispatches events.
JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events.
event loop works in a cyclic manner, where it continually checks whether or not the call stack is empty. If it is empty, new functions 
are added from the event queue. If it is not, then the current function call is processed.
